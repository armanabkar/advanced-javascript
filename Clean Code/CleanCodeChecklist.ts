// Clean Code is a code which is easy to read an understand "by humans"!

// Naming: descriptive names, be specific but don't be redundant, nouns for variables, properties and classes and verbs for methods, avoid slang, unknown abbreviations and be consistent

// Comment & Formatting: generally avoid comment and feel free to add "good" ones (legal, warnings, etc), user vertical formatting and separate concepts which are not closely related, keep lines short and use indentation, follow language specific style guides

// Functions: limit the number of parameters, should be small and do only one thing and this depends on level of abstraction and void mixed levels of abstractions, write DRY and avoid Side Effects

// Control Structures: prefer positive wording, avoid deep nestings and use guards, use polymorphism and factory functions, use real errors

// Objects: use real objects or data structure depending on what you need, should bes small and focused on one responsibility, follow Law of Demeter, follow SOLID principles (especially SRP & OCP)
